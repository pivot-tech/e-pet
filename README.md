# E-PET

In this project you will be tasked with building an E Pet application. Your pet will require a great deal of maintenance to stay happy, you'll need to be able to feed your pet, play with your pet, and make sure your pet gets some sleep. It will be a fun challenge that will test a lot of the skills you've learned thus far.
